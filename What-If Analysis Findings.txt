# What-If Analysis Findings

Our what-if analysis modeled several operational adjustments to determine how staffing and server efficiency influence wait times and service quality.

---

## Scenario: Base Case with 3 Servers
- **Impact**: Average wait time decreased by approximately 30%; maximum wait time reduced by around 2 minutes.
- **Insight**: Adding a third server improves efficiency meaningfully while maintaining manageable costs.

---

## Scenario: Base Case with 4 Servers
- **Impact**: Only marginal improvement in wait times.
- **Insight**: Additional labor cost outweighs performance gains. A fourth server is not cost-effective.

---

## Scenario: 1 Server During Peak Traffic
- **Impact**: Extremely high wait times and severe inefficiency.
- **Insight**: Understaffing during peak hours results in poor service and customer dissatisfaction.

---

## Scenario: 3 Servers During Peak Traffic
- **Impact**: Average and maximum wait times cut in half.
- **Insight**: A third server during peak periods offers strong performance gains and should be considered for strategic scheduling and cost minimization.

---

## Scenario: Slowest Server (Worst Efficiency)
- **Input**: Base case interarrival rate with worst-performing server (2.24 min).
- **Impact**: Average wait time increased to ~15 minutes; max wait time rose to 30 minutes.
- **Insight**: Staff performance dramatically affects outcomes. Training and performance management are critical, but it is important to note that slow service times are not always in the server's control (large transactions, customer disputes, etc).

---

These scenarios validate that **targeted staffing increases during peak periods** yield the best return on investment, while excessive staffing or reliance on underperforming servers leads to inefficiencies or wasteful spending.
